# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

1. **Overview of the analysis:** 

   ​	The analysis is based on Pewlett-Hackard 'Silver tsunami' of baby boomers leaving the workforce and intrested in the retirement package that Pewlett-Hackard is about to offer. The company is worried about the no. of employees that might opt-in for the retirement plan and wants to run an analysis on:

   - Number of Retiring Employees by Title


   - Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program


   

2. **Results:** 

   ​	The data results are based on the filter of employees born between Jan-1 1952 to Dec-31 1955 which is four years. Based on that filter we found out that following no. of employees are eligible for retirement benefits:

   ​	As we can see from the above picture, we are going to fill 60K senior positions only. That's a big number to fill and the total no. is 90K employees. The total no. of employees at Pewlett-Hackard is around 300K and losing 90K would be the 30% of the workforce. 

   ​	As for employees eligible for Mentorship program, we have 1,549 employees available.

   

3. **Summary:**

   ​	As stated above Pewlett-Hackard would be loosing 90K of its employees if it keep its filter criteria of 4years(1952-1955). The criteria should be broken down by 18months so on average we will see 20-30K employees leaving every year and this will give the company to caught up on the open position and mentor the new employees as well.

   ​	One last suggestion is to change the mentorship criteria from one year to five years.
